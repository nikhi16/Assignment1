    <h2><b>About the Department </b></h2>
<p>
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) was established in the year 2008 with an intake of 180 students with the approval of AICTE and is currently affiliated to JNTUK, Kakinada. The Department will be the center of Excellence with competent facility, State-of-Art laboratory equipment, and adequate infrastructure with the faculty strengths of 2 Professors, 4 Associate Professors and 18 Assistant Professors to train the students into leaders in their progression.<br>
The department has progressed with a strong commitment to developing competent programmers with uncompromising standard of excellence in the training, both class room sessions and hands on sessions, given to students.The department soon won laurels with the dedication and devotion of the faculty who are well qualified and rich experienced. Contribution of papers to National and international conferences and attending of FIPs by the faculty reflect their real for intellectual growth.<br>

The college has equipped with excellent computing facilities with cutting edge technology. All the computer labs are supported by appropriate software; Internet facility is available with 20Mbps leased line.</p><br>

<b>Prospects and Future of CSE</b><br><p>
This has been one of the most lucrative and competitive course to study since its inception in Engineering Colleges/Institutes and Universities. When Indiaâ€™s computer industry created mark in world of business and gained super trust and revenue for the nation it also created large amount of well paid jobs for Computer Engineering students.<br>
Computer science and engineering students will learn about basic engineering techniques, as other engineering students, during first year course. These techniques include Engineering Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Engineering Drawing, and C & Data structures. From second year they will be exposed to core computer science subjects like programming, advanced data structures, Digital logic design, Theoretical computer science, Algorithms, Computer networks, Operating systems, Web technologies, Databases and Computer Architecture are few to mention.<br>

This is really an excellent field to have opportunities both in software companies and higher studies. As computing is extensively applied to almost every walk of life it created massive jobs for Computer Engineering students. On the same time more demand and application kept it research funding alive attracting many students to opt for higher studies.<br>

Core companies offering jobs to Computer Science Graduates:
Government organizations like DRDL, ISRO, ECIL and BEL offer jobs to computer science students. There are thousands of multinational and national software companies which offer jobs to computer engineers. To name few famous, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, IBM, Facebook, Oracle, Cisco, Infosys, TCS, CSC and Wipro.</p><br>
