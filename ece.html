<h2>Prospects and Future of EEE</h2><br><p>
This has been one of the most lucrative and competitive course to study since its inception in Engineering Colleges/Institutes and Universities. When Indiaâ€™s computer industry created mark in world of business and gained super trust and revenue for the nation it also created large amount of well paid jobs for Electrical and Electronics Engineering students.<br>

Electrical and Electronics Engineering students will learn about basic engineering techniques, as other engineering students, during first year course. These techniques include Engineering Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Engineering Drawing, and C & Data structures. From second year they will be exposed to core computer science subjects like programming, advanced data structures, Digital logic design, Theoretical computer science, Algorithms, Computer networks, Operating systems, Web technologies, Databases and Computer Architecture are few to mention.<br>

This is really an excellent field to have opportunities both in software companies and higher studies. As computing is extensively applied to almost every walk of life it created massive jobs for Electrical and Electronics Engineering students. On the same time more demand and application kept it research funding alive attracting many students to opt for higher studies.<br></p>

<h3>Core companies offering jobs to Computer Science Graduates:</h3><br><p>
Government organizations like DRDL, ISRO, ECIL and BEL offer jobs to computer science students. There are thousands of multinational and national software companies which offer jobs to computer engineers. To name few famous, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, IBM, Facebook, Oracle, Cisco, Infosys, TCS, CSC and Wipro.<br></p>
